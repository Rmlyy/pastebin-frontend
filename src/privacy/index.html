      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>Effective Date: <b>9 August, 2023</b></p>

      <p>
        Thank you for using Rmly's Pastebin ("us", "we", or "our"). We are
        committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how
        we collect, use, and protect your personal information in connection
        with your use of our pastebin service.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h4>IP Address</h4>
      <p>
        We collect and store your IP address when you view, authenticate, or
        create a paste on our service. This information is only used for spam
        detection and prevention purposes. It helps us identify suspicious or
        malicious activities that may harm our service or compromise the user
        experience.
      </p>

      <h4>Paste Data</h4>
      <p>
        When you create a paste on our service, we collect and store the
        content, name and password of the paste for the duration of its
        existence. This is necessary to provide the paste-sharing functionality.
        Once a paste expires it's permanently deleted and its content is removed
        from our database and cannot be recovered.
      </p>

      <h4>Paste Password</h4>
      <p>
        If you choose to set a password for a paste, we encrypt the paste's
        password using the bcrypt hashing algorithm. We do not have access to
        the actual paste password as it is securely hashed and stored. This
        ensures that only you have the ability to access the paste content
        associated with the password.
      </p>

      <h4>Use of External Resources</h4>
      <p>
        To enhance the functionality and design of our service, we use the
        following external resources:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>jsDelivr CDN</b>: We use the jsDelivr Content Delivery Network to
          improve the loading speed and reliability of our service. This may
          involve your browser requesting certain resources from jsDelivr's
          servers, which could result in your IP address being shared with them
          temporarily. By using our service, you also agree to their

          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FontAwesome</b>: We use FontAwesome icons to enhance the visual
          experience of our service. These icons are loaded from FontAwesome's
          servers when you access our service. By using our service, you also
          agree to their

        <li>
          <b>Cloudflare</b>: We utilize Cloudflare services to enhance the
          security and performance of our service. Your traffic may pass through
          Cloudflare's network. By using our service, you also agree to their
          <a href="//www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank"

      <h2>Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        The information within the paste, including its content, name, and

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>

      <h4>IP Address</h4>
      <p>
        We retain your IP address for an indefinite period of time after your
        interaction with our service, solely for spam detection and security
        purposes. We do not use it for any other purpose.
      </p>

      <h4>Paste Data</h4>
      <p>
        Once a paste expires, it is permanently deleted from our database, and
        the content cannot be recovered. We do not retain or store expired paste
        content beyond the period of their existence.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>

          rights, privacy, safety, or property of our users or others.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of
          our assets, your information may be transferred as part of the
          transaction, subject to applicable privacy laws.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You can choose to create pastes and use our service anonymously, but
        please note that your IP address will be collected for spam detection
        purposes. You can also choose to discontinue the use of our service at
        any time.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any
        time. Changes will be effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy
        on our service. Your continued use of our service after the changes are
        posted signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
